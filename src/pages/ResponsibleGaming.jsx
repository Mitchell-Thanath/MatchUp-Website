          <p className="last-updated">This Responsible Gaming Policy was last updated on December 7, 2025.</p>
          
          <section className="policy-section intro-section">
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
            <p>MatchUp is fully committed to promoting responsible social gaming as a policy of customer care and social responsibility. We aim to provide the most fun, social, and rewarding sports prediction experience possible while taking appropriate measures to ensure this is done responsibly and in a way that fosters customer protection.</p>
            <p>We believe it is our responsibility to our customers to ensure that you enjoy your experience using our platform, while remaining fully aware of the potential risks that can be associated with social prediction gaming if you don't take the necessary safeguards to manage your play.</p>
            <p>To ensure that you continue to enjoy safe and manageable play, we fully support responsible social gaming and have put measures in place to assist players who wish to manage their play, and we reserve the right to activate these measures unilaterally if, in our sole discretion, we consider them necessary.</p>

          <section className="policy-section">
            <h2>1. KEEPING TRACK OF YOUR PLAY</h2>
            
            <p>1.1. Playing sports prediction games should be treated as a fun pastime. Here are some tips to help you manage your social gaming:</p>
            
            <h3>Keep it fun</h3>
            
            <p>1.2. Playing MatchUp is a form of entertainment, but it should be played in moderation and not to escape reality or for the purpose of generating income through winning prizes.</p>
            
            <p>1.3. Play prediction games in the right frame of mind and avoid playing if you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as this may impair your judgment and decision-making.</p>
            
            <p>1.4. Remember that even the most knowledgeable sports fans cannot predict every outcome. Uncertainty is part of the entertainment, not something to be frustrated by.</p>
            
            <h3>Don't spend above your means</h3>
            
            <p>1.5. Set a budget for your entertainment and stick to it. Only purchase Match Coins if you can afford to do so without impacting your ability to pay bills, buy necessities, or save for the future.</p>
            
            <p>1.6. You can always claim free Match Coins and Match Cash through:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Daily Login Bonus (10 Match Coins + $0.10 Match Cash per day)</li>
              <li>Alternative Method of Entry (AMOE) for Match Cash (see our Sweepstakes Rules)</li>
              <li>Welcome bonuses and referral rewards</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>1.7. Strictly manage your budget and don't chase losses. If you lose a matchup, resist the urge to immediately play again at a higher stake to "win it back." This behavior can lead to problematic gaming patterns.</p>
            
            <p>1.8. Consider Match Coins purchases as entertainment expenses, similar to going to a movie or sporting event. The money spent should be considered spent on entertainment, not as an investment.</p>
            
            <h3>Keep track of your playing time</h3>
            
            <p>1.9. We're happy you've chosen MatchUp and we hope that you can continue to enjoy playing, but don't let prediction gaming take up too much of your time. Just like going to a live sporting event or movie theater, MatchUp exists to provide entertainment, not to consume your day.</p>
            
            <p>1.10. Be mindful of how many matchups you play per day. Playing 1-3 matchups per day is typical recreational behavior. Playing 10+ matchups per day may indicate excessive play.</p>
            
            <p>1.11. Set time limits for yourself, such as "I will only play during games" or "I will only check results twice per day." Don't let MatchUp interfere with work, school, relationships, or sleep.</p>
            
            <h3>Make use of our gaming management tools</h3>
            
            <p>1.12. If you need some time out to cool-off or exclude yourself from the MatchUp platform for a longer period of time, you can follow the steps in section 2.</p>
            
            <p>1.13. Take advantage of our transaction history feature to review your spending patterns. Navigate to Settings &gt; Account &gt; Transaction History to see all your purchases and matchup activity.</p>
            
            <p>1.14. If you think you may be gaming too often, review the self-assessment questions in section 3 below.</p>
          </section>

          <section className="policy-section">
            <h2>2. STAYING IN CONTROL</h2>
            
            <p>2.1. We encourage our customers to play responsibly, so we offer a variety of responsible social gaming features.</p>
            
            <h3>Session Reminders</h3>
            
            <p>2.2. MatchUp can assist you to play responsibly by operating a Session Reminder each hour during active play.</p>
            
            <p>2.3. The Session Reminder:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>2.3a. Suspends matchup selection and indicates how long you have been actively playing.</li>
              <li>2.3b. Displays the number of matchups you've entered and total Match Coins and Match Cash played since logging in.</li>
              <li>2.3c. Allows you to end the session or continue playing after acknowledging the reminder.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>2.4. You can enable or disable Session Reminders in Settings &gt; Privacy & Security &gt; Responsible Gaming.</p>
            
            <h3>Set Daily, Weekly, and/or Monthly Limits</h3>
            
            <p>2.5. The daily, weekly, and/or monthly limits function provides you with options to pre-set:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>2.5a. How many Match Coins you can purchase each day, each week, and/or each month.</li>
              <li>2.5b. The amount of Match Coins and/or Match Cash you can wager in matchups each day, each week, and/or each month.</li>
              <li>2.5c. The maximum number of matchups you can enter each day, each week, and/or each month.</li>
              <li>2.5d. How much time you spend actively playing each day, each week, and/or each month.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>2.6. To pre-set a limit, once you have signed in, navigate to Settings &gt; Contact Support, and send us a message indicating you would like to set daily, weekly, and/or monthly limits on your MatchUp account usage. Please specify:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Type of limit (purchase, wager, matchup count, or time)</li>
              <li>Currency (Match Coins, Match Cash, or both)</li>
              <li>Period (daily, weekly, or monthly)</li>
              <li>Amount or number</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>2.7. We will respond accordingly and do our best to efficiently apply your requested limits or send you a follow-up response if further clarification is needed. The limits will not come into effect until they have been fully implemented and this has been communicated to you. If after this you find that the limits have not taken effect, it is your responsibility to please inform us immediately.</p>
            
            <p>2.8. You can request to change or revoke the limits you have set by sending us a request via Settings &gt; Contact Support and stating your intention to change or revoke the previously imposed limits. However, limits cannot be changed or revoked until the conclusion of the selected limitation period (e.g., a weekly limit cannot be increased until the week ends).</p>
            
            <p>2.9. Limit decreases take effect immediately. Limit increases take effect after a 24-hour cooling period.</p>
            
            <h3>Purchase Spending Reports</h3>
            
            <p>2.10. You can request a detailed spending report showing all Match Coins purchases made on your account by contacting Customer Support at support@matchupdfs.com. This report will include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Date and time of each purchase</li>
              <li>Package purchased and amount paid</li>
              <li>Payment method used</li>
              <li>Cumulative spending totals</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>2.11. We recommend reviewing your spending report monthly to ensure you are staying within your entertainment budget.</p>
            
            <h3>Cool-Off Periods</h3>
            
            <p>2.12. If you need to take a break from the MatchUp platform, you can select a cool-off period of 1 day, 7 days, or 30 days.</p>
            
            <p>2.13. To take a break, once you have signed in, navigate to Settings &gt; Contact Support and send us a message indicating you would like to take a cool-off period of 1 day, 7 days, or 30 days.</p>
            
            <p>2.14. Cool-off periods expire at the conclusion of the selected period and cannot be shortened in duration.</p>
            
            <p>2.15. During your cool-off period you will not have access to your MatchUp account. This means you will not be able to login, make purchases, enter matchups, or make predictions. If you require access to your MatchUp account history and information you will need to email Customer Support at support@matchupdfs.com.</p>
            
            <p>2.16. Any active matchups at the time of cool-off initiation will be automatically completed with default predictions if you haven't already submitted predictions. Your account will continue to receive winnings from any active matchups during the cool-off period.</p>
            
            <p>2.17. You may request Match Cash redemptions during your cool-off period (when redemption feature is available) by sending a request to Customer Support at support@matchupdfs.com.</p>
            
            <p>2.18. If you have an upcoming cool-off period scheduled, you will receive a reminder notification 24 hours before it begins.</p>
            
            <h3>Self-Exclusion</h3>
            
            <p>2.19. If you want to preemptively exclude yourself from the MatchUp platform so that you are unable to create a MatchUp account, you can email your request to support@matchupdfs.com. You can exclude yourself for 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years. The email must include your full name, residential address, email address, phone number, and date of birth to allow us to block you from registering and playing on the MatchUp platform in the future.</p>
            
            <p>2.20. If you have an active MatchUp account and want to exclude yourself from the MatchUp platform, once you have signed in, navigate to Settings &gt; Privacy & Security &gt; Request Account Deletion and follow the prompts to request self-exclusion, or contact Customer Support at support@matchupdfs.com indicating you would like to exclude yourself for 6 months, 1 year, 3 years, or 5 years.</p>
            
            <p>2.21. We will apply your self-exclusion as soon as practically possible, however, please note that this process takes a reasonable working period to implement (typically 24-48 hours). We will not consider the self-exclusion period as having commenced until it has been implemented by us and communicated to you. If after this you find that you can still access the MatchUp platform, it is your responsibility to inform us immediately.</p>
            
            <p>2.22. During a self-exclusion period, you will not have access to the MatchUp platform. Your account, including all Match Coins and redeemable Match Cash balances, will be frozen. If you require access to your account history and information you will need to email Customer Support at support@matchupdfs.com.</p>
            
            <p>2.23. At the conclusion of your exclusion period, it will only be possible to reactivate your MatchUp account by making a written email request to Customer Support at support@matchupdfs.com. Your exclusion period cannot be shortened in duration. However, you can extend the exclusion period at any time by emailing Customer Support.</p>
            
            <p>2.24. Once the self-exclusion is applied, you will no longer receive marketing materials from MatchUp. We strongly recommend that you also:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Seek exclusion from all other social gaming, daily fantasy sports, and sports betting platforms</li>
              <li>Unsubscribe from sports prediction and DFS-related social media channels</li>
              <li>Delete MatchUp from your mobile device</li>
              <li>Consider installing website and app blockers to prevent impulsive access</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>2.25. We may also exclude you from the MatchUp platform at our sole discretion if there are reasons to indicate that you may have a gaming problem, such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Excessive and rapid increases in play frequency or wager amounts</li>
              <li>Erratic or concerning behavior in customer support interactions</li>
              <li>Self-reported struggles with managing play</li>
              <li>Violation of responsible gaming policies</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Permanent Account Closure</h3>
            
            <p>2.26. You may choose to permanently close your MatchUp account. If you wish to do so, provide a written email request to Customer Support at support@matchupdfs.com.</p>
            
            <p>2.27. Before closing your account, you should:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Redeem any available Match Cash balance (when redemption feature is available)</li>
              <li>Understand that Match Coins have no cash value and cannot be refunded</li>
              <li>Request any account history or transaction records you wish to keep</li>
              <li>Understand that account closure is permanent and cannot be reversed</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>2.28. We reserve the right to refuse or close your MatchUp account in our sole discretion, pursuant to the agreed upon Terms of Service.</p>

            <h2>3. SELF-ASSESSMENT</h2>
            
            <p>3.1. If you think your or someone else's play on MatchUp is becoming problematic, then it may be a good idea to consider the self-assessment questions below.</p>
            
            <ul className="assessment-list">

              <li>3.1e. When upset, stressed, or anxious, do you use MatchUp as a way to escape or soothe your emotions?</li>
              <li>3.1f. Do you find yourself playing matchups late at night or early in the morning instead of sleeping?</li>
              <li>3.1g. Do you constantly check MatchUp on your phone during work, school, social events, or while driving?</li>

              <li>3.1j. Have you called in sick or late to work, or skipped classes, to watch games or make predictions?</li>
              <li>3.1k. Have you deleted MatchUp from your phone promising to quit, only to reinstall it later?</li>
              <li>3.1l. Do you feel guilt, shame, or regret about the time or money you spend on MatchUp?</li>
              <li>3.1m. Has your MatchUp usage contributed to arguments with family members, partners, or friends?</li>
              <li>3.1n. Has MatchUp taken the place of hobbies, exercise, social activities, or other interests you used to enjoy?</li>
              <li>3.1o. Do you forget appointments, responsibilities, or deadlines because you're focused on matchups or watching games?</li>
              <li>3.1p. Do you become defensive, irritated, or angry when people suggest you might be playing MatchUp too much?</li>

              <li>3.1r. Do you skip social events, family gatherings, or time with friends to play matchups or watch games?</li>
              <li>3.1s. Have you lost contact with friends and family since you started playing MatchUp?</li>
              <li>3.1t. Do you experience intense mood swings (excitement, anxiety, anger, depression) based on matchup results?</li>
              <li>3.1u. Do you chase losses by immediately entering higher-stake matchups after losing?</li>
              <li>3.1v. Have you spent money on MatchUp that was meant for bills, rent, groceries, or other necessities?</li>

              <li>3.1x. Have you borrowed money or used credit cards to purchase Match Coins?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>3.2. The more questions that you answer "yes" to, the more likely it is that you are having difficulties with your play. If you answered "yes" to 3 or more questions, we strongly encourage you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Contact the Support Organizations referred to in section 4</li>
              <li>Consider implementing cool-off periods or self-exclusion (section 2)</li>
              <li>Speak with a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>3.3. If you answered "yes" to questions 3.1u, 3.1v, or 3.1x (spending money meant for essentials, chasing losses, or borrowing money), please seek help immediately. These are serious warning signs of problematic gaming.</p>
